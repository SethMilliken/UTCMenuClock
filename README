This is an obscenely simple program to add the UTC time to the MacOS
Menu Status Bar. I desperately wanted two clocks as the network that I
work on uses UTC Time exclusively for all of our devices. Converting
in my head was a true pain.

You can download binaries here: 
https://github.com/netik/UTCMenuClock/tree/master/downloads

The binaries are not signed. I don't have an Apple Developer account
right now, so you should read this:
